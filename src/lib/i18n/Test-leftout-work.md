Flow diagram is missing.

Two toast notifications appear on a single step completion â€“ this needs fixing.

The overall UX needs improvement.

Rename auto_saved to something more meaningful.

RTL implementation is incomplete.

The "Write" button should follow a smoother flow.

Remove duplicate code.

On submission, display a popup confirming application submission with a proper ID.

Avoid hardcoding values.

Difference == vs === How can we achieve == behavior in javascript if we dont have '==' operator available

Answer (concise):
- == performs abstract equality comparison with type coercion; === performs strict equality without coercion.
- Example: 0 == '0' is true (string coerced to number), but 0 === '0' is false.
- Special: null == undefined is true; NaN is never equal to itself for both == and ===.

Practical tips:
- Keep SW messaging schema small and versioned (avoid hardcoding assumptions).
- Debounce/fold frequent messages before updating React state to avoid excessive re-renders.
- For complex flows, use Context or a state management store to provide SW data to many components.
- Use callbacks as props for event handling and prefer typed contracts (TypeScript) between page and SW messages.
